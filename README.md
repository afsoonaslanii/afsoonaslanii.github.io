## 🧭 About Me  
I’m a **Front-End Engineer** who loves the intersection of **performance, architecture, and design**.  
Over the past few years, I’ve specialized in building **scalable front-end systems** and **AI-powered experiences** using **React**, **Vue**, **Nuxt**, and **TypeScript**.  

What drives me isn’t just code — it’s the challenge of making something **beautifully engineered**:  
- Fast and accessible.  
- Easy to maintain.  
- A pleasure to use — and to build.  

I approach development as both **engineering and craftsmanship**: every line of code should serve clarity, speed, and purpose.

## 🧠 My Focus Areas
- **⚡ Performance Engineering** — bundle optimization, lazy loading, code splitting, caching strategies.  
- **🧩 Scalable Architectures** — reusable component systems, clean state management, and modular patterns.  
- **🎨 UI & DX Harmony** — bridging design systems with developer efficiency.  
- **🤖 Emerging Front-End Tech** — AI-driven tools, Remotion animations, Vite, and modern rendering pipelines.

## ⚙️ My Stack
**Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript  
**Frameworks:** React, Vue, Nuxt, Next.js, Remotion  
**State Management:** Redux, Recoil, Zustand, React Query, Pinia  
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS, MUI, SCSS, Styled Components, Shadcn  
**Build & Tools:** Vite, Webpack, ESLint, Git, WebSocket  
**Testing:** Cypress  
**Design Tools:** Figma, Zeplin, Adobe XD

## 🧩 How I Work
> “Great front-end isn’t just what users see — it’s how smoothly everything fits behind the scenes.”  

- I write **modular**, **readable**, and **documented** code.  
- I use **profiling and metrics** to guide optimizations, not assumptions.  
- I design **maintainable systems**, not one-off features.  
- I care deeply about **developer experience (DX)** — clear conventions and faster feedback loops.  

---

## 🧬 My Engineering Values
- **Clarity over cleverness.** Code should explain itself.  
- **Consistency breeds velocity.** Teams move faster with shared patterns.  
- **Less is more.** Performance often means removing, not adding.  
- **Design empathy.** Developers are users too — of the codebase.
